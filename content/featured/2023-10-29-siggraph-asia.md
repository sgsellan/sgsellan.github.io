I am really excited to be attending SIGGRAPH Asia in Sydney this December! [Reach out](mailto:sgsellan@cs.toronto.edu) if you want to meet up to chat, collaborate or if you want to talk about the three works that we will be presenting at the conference:

- [*Neural Stochastic Screened Poisson Reconstruction*](), in which Alec Jacobson and I show that the traditional Poisson surface reconstruction from point clouds can be computed with the aid of a neural network, making it easier to quantify its uncertainty and enabling applications like next best view planning and ray casting.
- [*Reach for the Spheres*](https://odedstein.com/projects/reach-for-the-spheres/), in which Oded Stein, Christopher Batty and I introduce a deceptively simple geometric algorithm to reconstruct surfaces from SDFs significantly better than both Marching Cubes and neural approaches. This was such a fun collaboration!
- [*Constructive Solid Geometry on Neural Signed Distance Fields*](https://zoemarschner.com/research/csg_on_neural_sdfs), a collaboration with Hsueh-Ti Derek Liu and Alec Jacobson led by the brilliant ZoÃ« Marschner in which we introduce a new regularizer to recover *true* Signed Distance Fields using neural coordinate networks.

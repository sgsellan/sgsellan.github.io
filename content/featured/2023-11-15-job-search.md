This Fall, I will be applying to tenure-track faculty positions in Computer Science in Europe and North America. My goal is to lead a multidisciplinary research team that builds on my previous and ongoing work on stochastic geometry processing and applies it to specific challenges in critical fields like medicine, engineering or journalism. [Let me know](mailto:sgsellan@cs.toronto.edu) if your institution is hiring and you think I could be a good fit!

Over the past three years, I have been learning more and more about using Blender to generate results for academic papers in Computer Graphics. At the same time, I have been sharing what I have learned in different venues and formats: internally with my colleagues, as aP course, as a text guide, a video or an interactive tutorial. As of July 2023, the last version of this was my 3-hour workshop at Graphics Interface 2023 in Victoria, Canada. In preparing for this workshop, I updated, reformatted and extended my previous publicaly available guides and combined them into a single course.

## Full, updated course

The course has three parts that you can access here in text format:

1. [Rendering a static figure using the Blender GUI](./blender_figure.html)
2. [Rendering an animation using the Blender GUI](./blender_videos.html)
3. [Rendering static figures and animations using Blender scripts](./blender_course_scripting.html)

## Previous editions

In 2022, I gave an earlier version of this tutorial as a video course at the Symposium on Geometry Processing (SGP) Graduate School, which you can watch <a href="https://youtu.be/cw88Y36qgDg">here</a>. Also in 2022, a text version of my static-figure-rendering tutorial was published by the SIGGRAPH Research Carreer Development Committee, which you can access <a href="https://research.siggraph.org/blog/guides/rendering-a-paper-figure-with-blender/">here</a>.

# abstract: 'Reconstructing a surface from a point cloud is an underdetermined problem. We use a neural network to study and quantify this reconstruction uncertainty under a Poisson smoothness prior. Our algorithm addresses the main limitations of existing work and can be fully integrated into the 3D scanning pipeline, from obtaining an initial reconstruction to deciding on the next best sensor position and updating the reconstruction upon capturing more data.'

Over the past three years, I have been learning more and more about using Blender to generate results for academic papers in Computer Graphics. At the same time, I have been sharing what I have learned in different venues and formats: internally with my colleagues, as an SGP course, as a text guide, a video or an interactive tutorial. As of July 2023, the last version of this was my 3-hour workshop at Graphics Interface 2023 in Victoria, Canada. In preparing for this workshop, I updated, reformatted and extended my previous publicaly available guides and combined them into a single course.

## Full, updated course

The course has three parts that you can access here in text format:

1. [Rendering a static figure using the Blender GUI](./blender_figure.html)
2. [Rendering an animation using the Blender GUI](./blender_videos.html)
3. [Rendering static figures and animations using Blender scripts](./blender_course_scripting.html)

## Previous editions

In 2022, I gave an earlier version of this tutorial as a video course at the Symposium on Geometry Processing (SGP) Graduate School, which you can watch <a href="https://youtu.be/cw88Y36qgDg">here</a>. Also in 2022, a text version of my static-figure-rendering tutorial was published by the SIGGRAPH Research Career Development Committee, which you can access <a href="https://research.siggraph.org/blog/guides/rendering-a-paper-figure-with-blender/">here</a>.

## Other

- [Here](./blender_compositing_compatibility.html)'s a note about a common bug that occurs when upgrading from Blender 2.9 to 3.0.

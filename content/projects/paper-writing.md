# # teaser_caption: 'We use a neural network to quantify the reconstruction uncertainty in Poisson Surface Reconstruction (center left), allowing us to efficiently select next sensor positions (center right) and update the reconstruction upon capturing data (right).'
# abstract: 'A course covering the different ways in which 2D and 3D geometry can be stored: from splines to meshes to point clouds and Signed Distance Functions (including a brief mention of Taylor Swift!). This course is aimed at undergraduate students with no prior experience with Computer Science at all, and only a minimal background in calculus.'

There are many skills not necessarily related to geometry or math that are required to make a polished SIGGRAPH submission. Every submission season, I end up going through a combination of my memory from the previous season, old Slack threads that I can only find with very specific keywords and trusting that google remembers the last time I searched for these things. No more! I will list the resources here so that I can come back to this site when the deadline approaches and, who knows, maybe you will find it helpful too!

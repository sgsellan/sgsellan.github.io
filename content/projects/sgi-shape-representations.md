# teaser_caption: 'We use a neural network to quantify the reconstruction uncertainty in Poisson Surface Reconstruction (center left), allowing us to efficiently select next sensor positions (center right) and update the reconstruction upon capturing data (right).'
abstract: 'A course covering the different ways in which 2D and 3D geometry can be stored: from splines to meshes to point clouds and Signed Distance Functions (including a brief mention of Taylor Swift!). This course is aimed at undergraduate students with no prior experience with Computer Science at all, and only a minimal background in calculus.'

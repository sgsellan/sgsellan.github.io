description: 'A course covering the different ways in which 2D and 3D geometry can be stored: from splines to meshes to point clouds and Signed Distance Functions (including a brief mention of Taylor Swift!). This course is aimed at undergraduate students with no prior experience with Computer Science at all, and only a minimal background in calculus.'

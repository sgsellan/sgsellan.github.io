description: 'We propose an algorithm to approximate heightfield surfaces with piecewise-developable (isometric to the plane) patches. Our algorithm builds on our observation that developability can be phrased as a minimal rank constraint on the heightfield''s Hessian, leading to a convex optimization problem.'

description: 'We characterize the space of Pseudo-SDFs, which are eikonal yet not true distance functions, and derive a novel regularizer that encourages the output to be an exact SDF. We demonstrate the applicability of our regularization to many operations in which traditional methods cause a Pseudo-SDF to arise, such as CSG and swept volumes, and produce a true (neural) SDF for the result of these operations.'

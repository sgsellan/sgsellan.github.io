description: 'An improved algorithm for isosurfacing of discrete signed distance fields (SDFs) that explicitly interprets each sample point as a sphere to which the surface must lie tangent. Especially at low grid resolutions, it can recover significantly more detail than marching cubes and Neural Dual Contouring.'

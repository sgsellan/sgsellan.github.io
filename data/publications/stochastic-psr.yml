description: 'We introduce a statistical extension of the classic Poisson Surface Reconstruction algorithm for recovering shapes from 3D point clouds. Instead of outputting an implicit function, we represent the reconstructed shape as a modified Gaussian Process. This perspective improves PSR''s integration into the online scanning process, broadens its application realm, and opens the door to other lines of research such as applying task-specific priors.'

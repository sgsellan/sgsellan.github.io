Hi ...!

Alright, here are the details (see https://toronto-geometry-colloquium.github.io for examples).

Overall: Provide final art at 300dpi, RGB 

The main illustration will fill a rectangle in the template. Please have the illustration fill to the edges of this rectangle.

Tiny portraits. Instead of plunking actual photos of our speakers alongside the illustration, we think it would be great if our poster illustrator sketched up a quick little portrait of the two speakers so that all images on the poster shared the same "artistic touch." To make things as easy as possible, you can literally just trace over these photos of the speakers for your talk, and use a small selection of colours from your main illustration. Keep it simple ;)

We will put the art together ourselves, you can just send us the three individual files.

We usually give artists a one-sentence prompt that they can interpret to make the main illustration. Yours is 

		"Shapes collide to create beautiful patterns"


If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, do let me know and I'd be happy to answer.

Our speakers are:
- Headliner: ...
- Opener: ...

You can find portrait photos of them below.

Our final art deadline would be ..., and we’d like to see three sketches from which to choose on or before ... .

Let me know if there’s any questions!

Silvia

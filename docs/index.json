Since then, we have successfully organized four seasons of our colloquium, which is still ongoing. In two years, we have hosted almost 80 speakers and accumulated over twenty thousand audience views. This document has two purposes: By the student-run nature of our colloquium, it is expected that organizers will graduate, go off on internships or step down for many other reasons. At the same time, new students will join the team with fresh energies and new ideas. We want this to serve as an internal guide for any future additions to our team, who will hopefully continue our colloquium in one way or another after the original organizers have (reluctantly!) moved on. Starting this colloquium was a lot of work. We have been approached by groups of students who want to organize similar initiative in other disciplines and institutions. By writing this guide, we hope to make the work of starting your own webseries slightly easier, so that we can all enjoy more diverse, quality talks in the future. We will organize this guide as a chronological checklist, grouping simultaneous tasks by topic.

Important decisions and internal logistics Decide on a mission. This sounds abstract, but it will become important later on as you decide on speakers and judge success. Some interesting questions to ask yourselves and make sure you agree on before you start: What (and how large) is your target audience? , Who are your target speakers?, How broad are the topics you are willing to cover?. Most importantly, What does success look like? Would producing a very popular series that covers only the most popular of topics with the most well-known speakers satisfy you? How about one that is less accessible, but very important to its niche audience? Or one that loses on nuance in favour of being accessible to the newest of undergraduate students? Or one that introduces new speakers to your field?. As an example, you can find our colloquium’s mission at the top of our website. Decide on a format. Ideally, this will be something that makes your webseries special. In our case, we took inspiration from live comedy or music shows and decided to pair an “opener” (more junior, speaking usually about one recent work) speaker with a “headliner” (usually more senior, giving a keynote-style talk that includes many works). Decide on a rough timeline: when do you want your first session to be? How often do you want to host sessions? When will you have breaks between seasons? Gather a (large) list of potential speakers that adjust to your mission statement. Survey members of your lab or colleagues about people they would be interested in hearing from, write down the names of authors of papers you really like. Don’t be afraid of being selfish: is there someone you are whose work you are really excited about? Add them to the list. A hundred names is an ambitious but reasonable target. Create a spreadsheet that all organizers have access to, containing all past and future session dates (see below). Set very clear rules and conventions for adding names to this spreadsheet: for example, names in italics denote “people we are considering inviting”, names in roman font denote “potential speakers that we have invited but have not yet responded” and names in bold denote “speakers that have agreed to participate”. This will help make it very clear which dates are filled and which dates aren’t, and will avoid the situation where several speakers are offered the same date. Agree on a distribution of labour among the team members. Running this (especially if it’s weekly) is a lot of work, so it is very important to parallelize it efficiently. Everyone should be confident that they can fulfill their own role, and everyone should trust all others to fulfill it, keeping horizontal communication to a minimum. For example, you may appoint a poster person, an email person, a social media person, a tech person and a host. In our case, the host role rotates weekly, while some people may take on more than one of the other roles at a given time. We will color-code the items of this mega-checklist so that each person can quickly identify their own personal checklist. Items in black should be shared by all. Tech preparation Create a simple website for your series of talks. You can spend as long as you want on this, but the minimal requirement is that it should list all upcoming talks, your mission statement and should link to all your social media. We are not expert web programmers but if you want to start somewhere, our html website repo is public. We use github pages to host the website for free. Create a Google Account and its Youtube Channel. Use your google account to create an empty, public Google Calendar where you will add any confirmed talks. We have found this is a the simplest, most accessible way of keeping a schedule.

It’s now time to prepare and run each individual session. Of course, the checklists for different sessions intersect: as you are inviting one speaker, you may be preparing the previous session’s poster and you are hosting the session before that. Something that has worked for us is setting a weekly time, for example, Mondays at 5 pm, where one goes through their role’s checklist for every upcoming talk as well as the shared spreadsheet and makes sure they are not behind schedule. This will also help limit your time commitment. 2 months before session Choose and contact an artist to produce the session’s poster. In the first email, you can inform them of the deliverables (in our case, two portrait images and one main illustration), deadline (ideally, at least 14 days before the session date) and budget (the 500 dollar range is a reasonable one). You do not need to provide many details yet, so you can do this before you have confirmed the speakers. Here’s an example of what that email can look like. If they refuse or you don’t hear back, ask a different artist until one accepts. Choose the speakers for the session. Anyone in the team can suggest names from the list, but care should be taken that the decision to invite them is unanimous. Send invitation letters to your chosen speakers. If they refuse or you don’t hear back from them, go back to the previous step and repeat until you have confirmed the speaker’s participation. Remember to keep the spreadsheet updated. Note: This action item can be very labor intensive, especially in the month before the series launch, so other team members may help with this step as well. A reasonable goal is to always have two pending invitations in the months before the series launch, to not get behind on filling up speaking slots. 1 month before session Add confirmed speakers to Google calendar and website. Send first reminder email to speakers, asking for talk title. You can send this email right after the speaker confirms. Send an email to the confirmed artist with all the poster details: speakers, topics, prompt, format, sketch deadline (usually a week before the final art deadline). Here’s an example of what this email can look like. 2 weeks before session Converge with artist on final poster. 1 week before session Create Youtube link for the session, using poster art. Create Zoom link for the session. Importantly, make sure you are enabling the Zoom waiting room and the room has a password that you only share with your team and the speakers. Add Youtube link to Google calendar and website. Add poster to the website. Start promoting the talk with posts on all social media, using poster art. Email second reminder to speakers. Day before session Write a detailed script. Don’t rush this step. Learn about the speakers, read their work, and craft proper, personalized, generous introductions for each speaker. They prepared a whole talk to present to you, they deserve a proper introduction. Here’s an example. Day of session 30 minutes before session start (T-30m) Share a reminder about the talk on all (internal and external) channels, including social media, with the live stream link. (T-15m) Open the Zoom room for the session. Make sure you are in “Speaker” view, not in “Gallery” view in Zoom. (T-15m) Open Youtube Studio. Enter the live stream control room. (T-15m) Welcome speakers to the room. (T-13m) Click on “Start livestream on custom live streaming service” in the Zoom room. It will take you to a website with some textboxes to fill. Use the information in the Youtube Studio livestream control room to fill these items out, and click on “Start Streaming”. (T-10m) Do a quick tech check with all speakers: check that they can properly share screen, that their videos/audio are shared properly.

You may want to do this because Blender 3.0’s rendering is extremely improved from the previous versions or because you started a project on 2.9/2.8 and now want to continue it in 3.0. There is only one compatibility issue I have encountered, but it can completely destroy your render. Say your Blender 2.8/2.9 file used compositing nodes, like my Blender 2.9 template paper figure file. The compositing view in Blender 2.9 may look like this: As you can see, we are passing “Noisy Image” from our render to the “Denoiser” node. However, if we open this same file in Blender 3.0, we see the following: The “Noisy Image” output has disappeared! And therefore nothing is going into our “Denoise” node. This is (I think) because Blender 3.0 no longer does denoising as post-processing in the compositing step; instead, you can turn on “Denoise” in the Render Output panel. If we choose to render the image, we will get empty RGB channels, because no RGB channels are entering the denoiser: Fixing this is simple: just circunvent the denoising node and connect the “Image” output from the Render node with the “Image” input of the next node in the chain; in my case, the “Bright/Contrast” one: And we can render and composit to get the expected result: ","date":"2022-03-03","objectID":"/blender_compositing_compatibility.html:0:0","tags":null,"title":"PSA: Update your compositing nodes for 3.0","uri":"/blender_compositing_compatibility.html"},{"categories":null,"content":"Every time I try to code a project in C++ I run into the same bugs, and I keep forgetting how to solve them.

Diagnosis: This happens because, when compiling, the compiler is reaching the same function or variable definition many times. For example, say we have a function main.cpp: #include \"func.h\"#include \"func2.h\"int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { func(0); func2(0); } which calls functions func.cpp #include \"func.h\"void func(int a){ std::cout \u003c\u003c a \u003c\u003c std::endl; } with header file func.h: void func(int a) and func2.cpp #include \"func2.h\"void func2(int a){ func(a+1); } with header file func2.h: #include \"func.h\"void func2(int a) When the compiler sees an include statement, it will literally just copy that file at that position in the code; and, of course, this works recursively. Therefore, since main is including func.h and func2.h, which in turn also includes func.h, when the compiler starts reading main.cpp and sees #include \"func.h\"#include \"func2.h\" it will interpret it as void func(int a) #include \"func2.h\" and then void func(int a) #include \"func.h\"void func2(int a) which recursively turns into void func(int a) void func(int a) void func2(int a) Thus, even without knowing it, we were defining the same function twice to the compiler’s eyes, and that makes it crash. Treatment: The best way to be protected against this is always using include guards, a smart trick to ensure that the compiler will only enter the main text of each header file once. Basically, envelop every header file you ever write in an if statement like this: #ifndef UNIQUE_NAME #define UNIQUE_NAME // header code here #endif Make sure that UNIQUE_NAME is unique for each header file and it never shares a name with any file or variable or functions ever read by the compiler. For example, you can make them all caps and make sure you never write all caps variable or function names. So, in our example, we would make func.h #ifndef FUNC #define FUNC void func(int a) #endif and func2.h #ifndef FUNC2 #define FUNC2 #include \"func.h\"void func2(int a) #endif By doing this, we avoid the compiler entering the same code twice and we avoid the error ","date":"2022-01-27","objectID":"/cpp_bugs.html:0:3","tags":null,"title":"Bugs I often write in C++","uri":"/cpp_bugs.html"},{"categories":null,"content":"There are a lot of great Blender tutorials online (e.g., the classic donut tutorial by Blender Guru), and they are usually aimed at artists or animators who want to generate full scenes from scratch for short films. Therefore they go into depth on how to model a shape, how to pick the best lighting, how to design a material, create textures, etc. These are really interesting topics, but they can be overwhelming if you are an academic and all you want is to render your object beautifully for a SIGGRAPH paper figure. For this use case, there is way less documentation online (my labmate Derek’s Blender scripting toolbox is a great exception), and in my experience this can lead to a lot of frustration especially when nearing deadlines, when one does not have the time or energy to learn a whole new aspect of the software just for a minor change in a paper figure. Mitigating that frustration is the goal of this guide. Also, one only needs to look through SIGGRAPH publications to see that all labs seem to have their own really polished “paper-quality rendering” pipeline, but unfortunately in my experience these mostly stay at the “tricks of the trade” level and aren’t shared very widely (not out of malice, there just aren’t many incentives for it). Another goal of this guide is to share my pipeline with people from other labs so that they (you) can hopefully learn something but also teach me something I am currently doing wrong or less efficiently (please email me!). Anyway, here we go. Let’s pretend you wrote a fancy new method in C++ or Matlab or Python that outputs a mesh called output.obj, and you want to render it to put it in a paper figure (if you want to make an animation for your paper video, please see my other guide). Download my Blender template file. Open Blender (you can download it from here). You’ll see something like this Before you do anything, go to Edit-\u003ePreferences, and on the Keymap section, pick Spacebar Action: Search. This will give you a very useful way of navigating the UI, instead of looking for each button you can just press spacebar and search for whatever is you’re looking for. This is something Oded Stein taught me when I started using Blender and it will completely change how you use the software for the better. Click on the cube on the middle of scene and then on the letter X to delete it, we won’t be using it. Go to File-\u003eImport-\u003e.obj and select your output.obj. It should appear in the screen: Pan and move your view in the viewport until you have a good view of the object (the controls for this differ, but on my MacBook I use the trackpad with two fingers to pan, CMD + two fingers to zoom and SHIFT + two fingers to move the viewpoint). Then, use the spacebar and type “Align Camera to view”. Press ENTER and you should see the frame of a camera appear. At this point, we can still move our view around and all we need to do is click on the camera icon on the top right of our scene to go back to this camera view: Let’s add a ground plane. To do this, we press Spacebar again and type “Plane”, choosing the mesh plane option. Let’s scale the plane so that it covers all the ground seen in the image. To do this we go to the object properties (clicking on the orange/yellow square icon on the bottom-right toolbar), and input values for the X and Y scale; for example, 20 for each A good practice to have after we’ve done a transformation like a translation, rotation and scaling and we are happy with it, is to “apply it”, i.e., lock it and make it permanent, turning a 1-by-1 scaled up plane into a 20-by-20 unscaled one. The difference is nuanced but it will be noticeable if you later use textures or physics. To do this we just use the spacebar and type “Apply all transformations” A note: Blender loves crashing on you and deleting your progress. Save your .blend file and do it often.

You can solve this (as Oded Stein showed me) by re-mapping the alpha values in the Blender Compositor (see the “Compositor” tab in the top of your blender UI).

It can ruin the feeling of interactivity in the software: what I like most about rendering paper figures using the Blender UI is that you can change something in your scene and see how that affects the image, and iterate like that. One way of getting this immediate feedback without spending thousands of dollars in graphics cards is to use a really nice feature called “Render Region”. Basically, this relies on the fact that when you’re iterating some aspect of your image, it is rare that you’re really looking everywhere in the figure to evaluate your changes. For example, if I am playing with the material of the main object, I could just look at one part of it to iterate instead of asking the render to simulate all the shadows and other objects in the scene. See what I mean by choosing the “Render Region” option, which I do by pressing Spacebar and searching for it: Then, I drag my mouse to select a really tiny region of my render I can them zoom in (CMD + Mouse Wheel in my Mac) and focus on the region I’m rendering: Since now the preview is only rendering this tiny part of the figure, it will update much much faster when you change aspects in your scene; for example, the width of the wireframe: Important: Make sure to remove your render region before you run the final render of your scene for your paper.

It was hard not to feel like the same government was choosing to invest money in me, a white privileged European with no connection to this land, rather than on alleviating these injustices.

In my case, I asked both my PhD advisor and an industry researcher who mentored me on a research internship that ended in a published paper. They were both generous enough to accept, and since they submit their letters privately through the ResearchNet server, I don’t have much to add. A common question is What do I do if I have only ever done research with one person; for example, my PhD advisor? Who can be my second reference? This will heavily depend on your discipline and specific situation but, generally, I would say it is better to pick someone in your field who you haven’t worked with directly but who knows you and your work (say, another professor in your advisor’s department or lab) rather than a senior professor who knows nothing about your research.

My personal opinion is that this item is yet another institutional barrier that discriminates against students that come from countries outside North America whose languages are different from English and French and do not have the tradition of writing reference letters. It honestly feels incredible that they keep this as an application item. But oh well, what are we going to do, we don’t make the rules. I arrived in the English/French speaking world in late 2019, so despite having done activism and volunteering in my life, I don’t have anyone in a leadership role in my life who can write a good letter in any of these languages attesting to my life and research trajectory. I also haven’t done any music training or sports either. So I had no idea who to ask for a leadership letter, let alone two. To make it even more awkward, you must submit the letters, not the recommenders themselves, so it will be hard to convince people from the academic world to write one for you since they are used to submitting confidential letters. I started by asking an amazing professor who visited our lab for a sabbatical year, whom I had never done research with but with whom I had built a nice professional relationship during her year here. She was nice enough to write a really generous letter about me, emphasizing my work to keep morale up within our lab and to offer to help people whenever they need help with anything, as well as to include people in our lab’s social events. I am obviously not going to share her letter here publicly. I spent weeks without a second leadership letter. I asked a labmate of mine, who I thought maybe could attest to the same items the previous recommender had, but he (probably correctly) politely recommended I ask someone else. Then, I rememberd a friend of mine from my undergrad was now studying in the UK, and I asked him to write me a letter as a personal favour. He emphasized my activism during our college years as well as my struggles as a trans person enduring institutional discrimination during those years. Again, I am not going to share his letter publicly. I really thought this item would be the one I would lose the scholarship over. My only senior, leadership-position recommender was academic, which went slightly against the stated spirit of the letters, and she had only known me for under a year. My other letter was from a first-year Master’s student who had been my peer and also from an academic background, and all he did was reaffirm what I had already brought up in my own leadership statement. However, I got my highest score in the Leadership item, so I must have done something right inadvertently.

I tend to always reply with a version of the same answer, so in the interest of my own reference and that of rooms without any trans people in them, I post it publicly here. Important disclaimer: What follows is exclusively my own, personal, subjective opinion, as one trans person with experience filling out and creating these forms. I speak only for myself, and not for any group of people. Following this advice does not absolve you or shield you from criticism from other people with experiences different from my own. If you are looking for the answer to How should I ask about people’s name and gender in this form?, there are many resources written by much better informed, more knowledgeable people than me whose job it is to answer this question. You probably want to click on one of the following links instead of continuing reading this post: UBC’s Equity and Inclusion Office’s “Inclusive Forms”. Vanderbilt LGBTQI office’s “Asking about sex, gender, or sexual orientation on a form, survey or project”. Keshet’s “A guide to Creating LGBT-Inclusive Forms”. Despite the existence of these resources (they are all on the first google search page for “trans inclusive gender form” as I type this), academic forms in my field, even when written with the best of intentions, tend to not incorporate a lot of the common advice in the links above. Perhaps, I imagine, this is because it can be hard to know which links to trust and it is easier to follow advice if it comes from someone you know and (hopefully) trust. So, if you are looking for the answer to hey Silvia, how would you ask about name and gender in this form?, then you are in the right place. What follows is my usual answer. ","date":"2021-07-04","objectID":"/gender_question.html:0:0","tags":null,"title":"Silvia, how would you ask about name and gender in this form?","uri":"/gender_question.html"},{"categories":null,"content":"Do you really, really need to ask for people’s gender? Gender is a deeply personal part of how a person perceives themselves. For many, being asked about their gender is just as invasive a question as being asked for your religious affiliation or sexual orientation. So, before including a question about gender in a form, ask yourself: Why do I need this information? The following are (some) not valid answers to this question: You never know! I am curious. We are inheriting a form from years ago that asked about gender. We use an IT system that asks about gender by default. It’s just standard demographic data! I want to know what pronouns to use when addressing someone (in this case, you want to ask about pronouns, not about gender). Some valid answers (may) include: I want to collect aggregate demographic data to analyze the gender parity of the event attendees. I know gender minorities face additional challenges in academia so I want to weigh a person’s gender when evaluating their application. Assuming you have a valid answer to the question above, here’s some advice: Drop “preferred”, “self-identified”, “womxn” and similar words; instead, be explicit My understanding is these words are usually added with the best of intentions to ensure that a trans person filling out the form does not feel the need to deadname or misgender themselves. This is an admirable goal. However, my reaction to these terms is that it feels patronizing (talking about someone’s preferred name or someone being woman-identifying makes it sound in contraposition to someone’s real name or real women) and, more importantly, it feels to me like using dogwhistle words that the author of the form uses as a signal only to trans people that the form is trans-inclusive but in a way that impacts the experience of cisgender people the least. Ask yourself: why am I making such an effort so that cisgender people do not realize that this is a trans-inclusive form? Instead of using these words, be explicit and send a message to all people. For example, instead of asking for a person’s preferred name and preferred pronouns, your form can look like this: Name: We are a trans-inclusive organization. Pick whichever name you would like us to refer to you by Pronouns: We are a trans-inclusive organization. Pick whichever pronouns you would like us to use to refer to you in the third person. Explain what the answer will be used for Many trans people will answer gender/name/pronouns questions differently depending on what the answers will be used for. If the name will be used for tax reasons, a trans person may use a different name than if the name will be used to address that person in emails, and a different name than if it will be shared publicly or used for sending regular mail to the person’s address. Instead of assuming which name people use for each purpose, state the purpose clearly and let the person make the informed choice. For example: Name: We will use this name to refer to you in our emails to you. Gender: For aggregate, statistical purposes only. or Name: We will use this name in all our payroll documentation and tax forms. It will not be shared with anybody else. Gender: We are a trans-inclusive organization. We are proud to be an affirmative action employer and do not discriminate based on race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, veteran status, disability status, or any other applicable characteristics protected by U.S. law. or Name: We will share this name, next to your photo, in our website and advertising materials. As stated above, if you do not know the purposes for which you will use the gender information, that is probably a sign that you do not need to be asking about it. Make it (or, at a minimum, add a) write-in option Ideally, gender should be a write-in field. Only if your form is going to be used by so many people that manually parsing the answers will be impossible, you may use a multiple-choice question, but this o","date":"2021-07-04","objectID":"/gender_question.html:0:1","tags":null,"title":"Silvia, how would you ask about name and gender in this form?","uri":"/gender_question.html"},{"categories":null,"content":"(Good) Examples From the WiGRAPH mailing list sign-up sheet.

Also, it took me a long time to learn these steps because of the lack of a guide like this, so I write this in hopes it may help young students starting out. I will assume that you have a set of meshes in .obj format, with ordered names like iteration-001.obj, iteration-002.obj, … iteration-099.obj, iteration-100.obj. Open Blender (you can use my template file). Install the OBJ Sequence Blender add-on. In Blender, press SHIFT+a and choose Mesh-\u003eMesh Sequence. Then, an empty object called “sequence” will appear in the scene. Select this object and go to Object Properties -\u003e Mesh Sequence. Choose the root folder where your .obj files are, being careful to uncheck relative pathing (this is a bug in the Mesh Sequence Add-on). Then, in “file name”, write a string which matches the beginning of the names of all meshes, like iteration. Finally, click “Load Mesh Sequence”. This can take a few minutes if your meshes are many or very large. In Output Properties-\u003eDimensions, choose the dimensions of your animation in pixels (for example, 1920x1080px). In some versions of Blender, the “End” frame is set to 250 by default. This will make your “Baking” step much more expensive than necessary if your animation contains way less meshes, and you may miss the end of your animation if there are more than 250 meshes in your sequence. Make the “End” value the total number of meshes in your sequence (careful with 1-indexing and 0-indexing). Now, finalize all the details of your scene. It is especially important that at this step, you pick the materials and shading information for your mesh sequence, since you will not be able to change it afterwards. At this point, I usually save a copy of my .blend file called pre-bake.blend so that I can go back to this step if I want to iterate on my result. In Object Properties-\u003eMesh Sequence, choose Smooth or Flat shading and click “Bake Mesh Sequence”. Now, if you go to the “Animation” tab, you can press Play or drag the blue time bar to see the progression of your animation. In Object Properties-\u003eOutput, make sure your output directory is set to a known relative path like // or //pngs/. This is important, because some Blender make /tmp/ by default and you may completely lose your renderings if you don’t change this. Select “File Extensions”, unselect “Cache Result”, choose “File Format: PNG”, “RGBA”, “Color Depth: 8”, “Compression: 15%”, select “Image Sequence: Overwrite” and unselect “Image Sequence: Placeholders”. Save and exit Blender. Now, in the command line and in the same directory as your .blend file. Run blender -b filename.blend -a. This will take a while. The rendering step will create a sequence of .png like 001.png, 002.png, …, 099.png, 100.png. These will be transparent, which doesn’t look great for an animation, so we can preprocess these by running mogrify -flatten *.png (this assumes you’ve installed ImageMagick, which in MacOS you can do with brew install imagemagick). Put the images together into a video by running ffmpeg -r framerate -f image2 -s 1920x1080 -i %04d.png -vcodec libx264 -crf 15 -pix_fmt yuv420p video.mp4, substituting framerate with how many of the pngs you want per second (this assumes you’ve installed ffempg, which in MacOS you can do with brew install ffmpeg). (Optional) If you want to reduce the size of your final .mp4 file, you can do so by running HandBrakeCLI -i video.mp4 -o 'video-compressed.mp4' -O --preset 'Normal' (this assumes you have installed Handbrake, which on a Mac is as easy as brew install handbrake) ","date":"2021-01-24","objectID":"/blender_videos.html:0:0","tags":null,"title":"Rendering an animation with Blender","uri":"/blender_videos.html"},{"categories":null,"content":"There are many skills not necessarily related to geometry or math that are required to make a polished SIGGRAPH submission.

I am writing to apply to the direct entry PhD program, to hopefully begin in Fall 2019. I believe my previous achievements can vouch for my ability to proficiently participate in a world-renowned institution like University of Toronto, and I hope my interdisciplinary training can bring to it an innovative perspective.

Their purpose is to show that I have the experience you’re looking for as a recruiter and I am confortable describing and discussing the details of my research. Also, detailing the specific responsabilities I took on with each project.] By this summer I will be granted two individual Bachelor of Science degrees in both Mathematics and Physics. However, for the past two years I have been dedicating myself mostly to my Computer Graphics research, supervised by professor Alec Jacobson (University of Toronto) and partially funded by several Fields Institute of Mathematics programs. Specifically, I have focused on the subfield of Geometry Processing, working with two or three-dimensional shapes in the form of meshes and using mathematical tools to analyze and manipulate them. In our latest finished project, we circumvented the problem of achieving solid meshes of complex domains by presenting a new way to define discrete differential operators on simpler meshes that make up the final domain via set operations. The applications of our method are manifold, from shape deformations to data smoothing to the computation of solid geodesic distances in a complicated shape. Our work has so far resulted in one high-level publication of which I am the first author, “Solid Geometry Processing on Deconstructed Domains”, which has been accepted with major revisions in the journal Computer Graphics Forum. I have also presented our results in poster format in several venues, like the 2018 Eurographics Symposium on Geometry Processing or the Graphics Interface 2018 conference. Lately, I have begun working on a new project, also supervised by professor Jacobson, involving morphological operations and geometric flows on surfaces, which is still on its early stages but the results of which we intend to submit for publication in Spring 2019. [This ended up happening in Spring 2020!] As the first author and the only student working on these projects for most of their duration, I took on the main responsibilities associated with them: with my supervisor’s assistance, we produced the necessary code and mathematical results and presented them in the most polished way possible, both in poster and paper form. I also worked on satisfying the reviewers’ comments during our first peer-review phase and submitted an improved version of our paper which complied with the major revisions required and is currently under review.

A representative sample of the anonymous feedback collected by professor Justin Solomon is reproduced below, each paragraph corresponding to different student: Silvia Sellán’s presentation was idyllic, it gave the feeling of being a duck in a pond being fed delicious crumbs of bread, the students being the duck and Silvia the feeder throwing in one after another the information that we like the ducks devoured. The presentation itself was amazing to go beyond analogy it was clear and concise towards learning the topic, the information did not feel too overwhelming, nor too brief. The exercises as well as giving focus upon them and breaking them apart into which to do at what times, they felt like the perfect amount of material in order to have us learn and test our knowledge of the topics. I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed Silvia’s programme. Cutting out all the formulas definitely made her material really accessible and easy to follow without worrying about the precise details of what is going on. I think leaving these details for us to figure out by doing the exercises is really good for developing understanding, rather than having a perhaps more technical talk which is harder to follow and then not quite knowing how to approach the exercises. Silvia’s lecture was the easiest to follow and the most approachable. Silvia’s tutorial: Lively and engaging, I liked how a narrative that tied in everything together neatly was presented. I really liked Silvia Sellan’s tutorial day because for the presentations she gave us a story illustrating the motivation behind the concepts and theory and the actual coding assignments were very accessible and did not require a lot of background material. I think a very good example of this was Silvia Sellan’s tutorial day. She approached the advanced topics from a big picture perspective and all of the coding exercises needed “basic” MATLAB and knowledge of calculus and a small amount of linear algebra. I thoroughly enjoyed Silvia’s talk and the associated exercises. I also found Silvia’s talk very valuable, not only for the geometry processing material offered (which was undoubtedly great, well-structured and very accessible), but also for increasing our awareness about potential nefarious uses of geometry processing. Also the brief digressions on true diversity when talking about fonts/letters were in my opinion very welcome – I (unfortunately) tend to think in a very ““westernized”” way, and it’s always good to bring awareness to things outside of our intellectual comfort zone. I really liked Silvia Sellán’s day of the tutorial week. I think she did a really good job of creating presentations and exercises that met me where I am as a student without a formal experience in geometry processing. The mathematics and computer science that she talked as well as exercises she designed were accessible to me as someone who has undergraduate majors in mathematics and computer science as well as had participated in larger projects with programming computer graphics components. I also think she did a really good job of telling and motivating a story, which was really important to staying engaged throughout the day. I also really appreciate that she spoke about ethics in computing and the need to think critically about academic work. It’s definitely something that is not spoken enough about and that needs to be spoken about more. YOU GUYS ARE WONDERFUL! Not gonna lie, I started looking at PhD opportunities to pursue this field after attending this program.

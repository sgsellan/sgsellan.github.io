    <description><![CDATA[Gpytoolbox version 0.1.0 has just been released!! You can install it directly through pip:
1  pip install gpytoolbox   Gpytoolbox shines when it comes to letting you test out your research ideas on simple 2D geometry before you commit to more complex three-dimensional examples and elaborately optimized implementations. Often, our final algorithm will use triangle meshes to represent surfaces in 3D. This means that, when prototyping in 2D, we will work with its equivalent: curves built by connecting flat segments (edges), which are usually called polylines.]]></description>

There are many reasons why you may want to compute the minimum distance from a given point in 2D to a polyline: for example, to guide sampling or as a stopping criterion in iterative algorithms.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Introduction: showing scripting screen in GUI Let&rsquo;s open any Blender file, like our template file, and let&rsquo;s fine-tune it a little bit; for example, by changing the main object&rsquo;s position.
We can now navigate to the scripting window by clicking on the top right, next to compositing, to find something like this
If we look closely at the console of the left, we can see a history of all the recent commands that have been applied to this file through its user interface.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[For the most part, you can open and render your Blender 2.9 files using the new and improved Blender 3.0. You may want to do this because Blender 3.0&rsquo;s rendering is extremely improved from the previous versions or because you started a project on 2.9/2.8 and now want to continue it in 3.0. There is only one compatibility issue I have encountered, but it can completely destroy your render.
Say your Blender 2.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Every time I try to code a project in C++ I run into the same bugs, and I keep forgetting how to solve them. So, I decided to write this list here for my own reference.
Eigen initialization bug Symptoms: The code compiles and runs properly, but the output seems random and changes from one run to the next, despite the code being theoretically deterministic.
Diagnosis: This happens because you am declaring a variable and calling it without initializing it.]]></description>

    <title>Rendering a paper figure with Blender</title>

    <description><![CDATA[There are a lot of great Blender tutorials online (e.g., the classic donut tutorial by Blender Guru), and they are usually aimed at artists or animators who want to generate full scenes from scratch for short films. Therefore they go into depth on how to model a shape, how to pick the best lighting, how to design a material, create textures, etc.
These are really interesting topics, but they can be overwhelming if you are an academic and all you want is to render your object beautifully for a SIGGRAPH paper figure.]]></description>

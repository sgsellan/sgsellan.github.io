\begin{rSection}{Anonymous teaching feedback}

\cvitem{Summer Geometry Institute}{2021}{During the summer of 2021, I planned, prepared and conducted a 6-hour long tutorial session on the topic of shape representations for undergraduate students of underrepresented communities, as part of MIT's Summer Geometry Institute (SGI). A representative sample of the anonymous feedback collected by professor Justin Solomon about my teaching is reproduced below, each quotation corresponding to different student:}

\feedback{``Silvia Sellán's presentation was idyllic, it gave the feeling of being a duck in a pond being fed delicious crumbs of bread, the students being the duck and Silvia the feeder throwing in one after another the information that we like the ducks devoured. The presentation itself was amazing to go beyond analogy it was clear and concise towards learning the topic, the information did not feel too overwhelming, nor too brief.  The exercises as well as giving focus upon them and breaking them apart into which to do at what times, they felt like the perfect amount of material in order to have us learn and test our knowledge of the topics."}

\feedback{``I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed Silvia's programme. Cutting out all the formulas definitely made her material really accessible and easy to follow without worrying about the precise details of what is going on. I think leaving these details for us to figure out by doing the exercises is really good for developing understanding, rather than having a perhaps more technical talk which is harder to follow and then not quite knowing how to approach the exercises."}

\feedback{``Silvia's lecture was the easiest to follow and the most approachable."}

\feedback{``Silvia's tutorial: Lively and engaging, I liked how a narrative that tied in everything together neatly was presented."}

\feedback{``I really liked Silvia Sellan's tutorial day because for the presentations she gave us a story illustrating the motivation behind the concepts and theory and the actual coding assignments were very accessible and did not require a lot of background material."}

\feedback{``I think a very good example of this was Silvia Sellan's tutorial day. She approached the advanced topics from a big picture perspective and all of the coding exercises needed "basic" MATLAB and knowledge of calculus and a small amount of linear algebra."}

\feedback{``I thoroughly enjoyed Silvia's talk and the associated exercises."}

\feedback{``I also found Silvia's talk very valuable, not only for the geometry processing material offered (which was undoubtedly great, well-structured and very accessible), but also for increasing our awareness about potential nefarious uses of geometry processing. Also the brief digressions on true diversity when talking about fonts/letters were in my opinion very welcome -- I (unfortunately) tend to think in a very ""westernized"" way, and it's always good to bring awareness to things outside of our intellectual comfort zone."}

\feedback{``I really liked Silvia Sellán's day of the tutorial week. I think she did a really good job of creating presentations and exercises that met me where I am as a student without a formal experience in  geometry processing. The mathematics and computer science that she talked as well as exercises she designed were accessible to me as someone who has undergraduate majors in mathematics and computer science as well as had participated in larger projects with programming computer graphics components. I also think she did a really good job of telling and motivating a story, which was really important to staying engaged throughout the day. I also really appreciate that she spoke about ethics in computing and the need to think critically about  academic work. It's definitely something that is not spoken enough about and that needs to be spoken about more."}

\feedback{``YOU GUYS ARE WONDERFUL! Not gonna lie, I started looking at PhD opportunities to pursue this field after attending this program."}

\cvitem{Summer Geometry Institute}{2021}{During the summer of 2021, I worked as a volunteer mentor for undergraduate students of underrepresented communities, as part of MIT's Summer Geometry Institute. A representative sample of the anonymous feedback about my mentoring collected by professor Justin Solomon is reproduced below, each quotation corresponding to different student:}

\feedback{``I still have no idea what Silvia's role was, but she went above and beyond to help out with everything. She made us all feel welcome in the Slack channel before SGI even started and continued to dole out advice and support throughout the whole of SGI. She also patiently answered my millions of questions almost as quickly as I could ask them."}

\feedback{``Silvia ensured we all felt welcome right from the beginning of the Slack channel. When we introduced ourselves, I noticed she found something nice to say to each of us, and it felt very welcoming to have that display of friendliness right from the get-go."}

\feedback{``Silvia Sellán, I would like to thank you specifically for the SGP \& Siggraph 2021 wiggraph event, sharing your thoughts in grad school event and being accessible."}

Hi ... !

We are currently gathering artists for our season 3 which will start in September. Would you be willing to create an illustration (plus two small portraits) for one of our posters? Our budget is 500 CAD and I am happy to send more details if youâ€™re interested :)

We are trying to fill several spots but if you were interested we would be looking to a final art deadline of early October.

Let me know!

Silvia

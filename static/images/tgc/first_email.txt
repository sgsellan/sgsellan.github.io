Dear ...

Thank you for accepting our invitation! We have confirmed your talk on ...

Here are a list of reminders:
- Could you please send us the title of your talk *one month* before the talk?
- Could you send us the abstract and your bio *one week* before the talk?
- Please leave the top-right corner of the slide empty (see the attachment) as the video of you will appear there during the live streaming.
- Would you be willing to stay for an extra hour after the talk to meet with students in our lab?

Thank you again, we are all really excited to hear you speak!

Best,
...

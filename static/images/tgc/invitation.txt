Dear ... , 

We are writing to cordially invite you as a headline speaker at the Toronto Geometry Colloquium. We find your work on ... would draw a captive audience to our colloquium.

The Toronto Geometry Colloquium is a live weekly hour-long webseries showcasing geometry processing research with topics from mathematics, computational fabrication, machine learning, numerical optimization, and computer graphics. The unique format of the Toronto Geometry Colloquium pairs one 10-min opener speaking about a recent work with a 40-min headliner giving a keynote-style presentation. 

Part of Toronto Geometry Colloquium's mission is to promote young researchers and showcase great geometry processing research by members of traditionally underrepresented communities. Talks are broadcast live over youtube and recordings are available thereafter. The talks will be advertised on our website (https://toronto-geometry-colloquium.github.io) and on twitter (https://twitter.com/GeometryToronto?s=20). 

The Toronto Geometry Colloquium is held weekly on Fridays at an hour that accommodates the headline speaker's timezone. Would you be available to be our headline speaker on our next available date ... ? If so, could you please provide a range of hours that would work for you? 

As a headliner, your talk is allotted 40 mins and we will have a 10 mins Q&A after the talk. Acknowledging the geometry processing focus of the colloquium, the subject of the talk is left entirely up to you! 

Would you accept our invitation to speak? 
Looking forward to hearing your answer by ... !

Sincerely,

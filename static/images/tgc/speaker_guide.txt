Thank you both for coming! I will now give you a quick rundown of how everything is going to work. 

While this is going to be livestreamed on Youtube, as far as you are concerned you can pretend that you are only presenting to the people in this zoom room. We will handle all the tech and questions on the Youtube side, so you don't need to worry about that. In fact, we recommend that you do not open the youtube stream at all, since there is a delay and it will be very annoying to hear yourself speak with lag while you are presenting.

Cronologically, here is how the session is going to go:

In a few minutes, right before the clock strikes (start hour), we will ask that you all turn your microphones and cameras. Then, we will stay in complete silence for about a minute until (Name of Tech Person) says "Hello, welcome to the Toronto Geometry Colloquium". That instant is the one when we will be live on Youtube. After that, the rest of the team members will say a few words and then I (the host) will take over. 

I will start by introducing (opener name). They will then give their 10-minute presentation. Then, I will go straight to introducing (headliner name). After their talk is over, I will moderate a Q&A for both of you at the end.

When the Q&A is over, I will say something like "Goodbye everyone, see you next week". At this point, instead of saying goodbye, please remember to again turn off your microphone and camera and stay in the Zoom room in total silent until [tech person] says "We are off the air".

Feel free to turn off your camera while you are not speaking, as only the video of the person currently presenting will be broadcast.

Any questions?
